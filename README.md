It has 10 java programs with test cases

In this exercise I solved problems like:

1.Java method to Reverse the given input & Check if it is a Palindrome.

3.A class named Member with Name, age, Salary as its variable, write an other
class named Member Variable that creates an instance of the Member class, initialises its

4.Java program to read the content of a text file, convert the content in upper case

5.A boolean method called isEven() in a class called EvenNumTest, which takes
an int as input and returns true if the input is even. The signature of the method is as
follows: public static boolean isEven(int number)
